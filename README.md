# Photo and Webcam Recognition Using ResNet SSD

## Overview
This project implements an object detection application using the ResNet SSD (Single Shot Detector) model for recognizing objects in images and real-time video streams from a webcam. The application is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of deep learning for computer vision tasks.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Detects various objects in static images and live webcam feeds.
- **Real-time Processing**: Utilizes efficient algorithms for real-time object detection, allowing quick analysis of video streams.
- **Bounding Boxes**: Draws bounding boxes around detected objects, providing visual feedback for recognized items.
- **Multiple Classes**: Supports detection of multiple object classes as defined by the SSD model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Numpy
- Pre-trained ResNet SSD model and configuration files
- Class labels file (e.g., `coco.names`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PhotoWebcamRecognition.git
   cd PhotoWebcamRecognition
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy  # or pip install opencv-python torch torchvision for PyTorch
   ```
3. Download the pre-trained ResNet SSD model weights and configuration files:
   - ResNet SSD weights
   - ResNet SSD configuration file
   - Class labels file (e.g., coco.names)
   
   Place these files in the project directory.

## Usage
1. **Run the application**:
   To start the object detection, execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **For webcam detection**:
   Ensure your webcam is connected and functional. The application will start processing the video feed.

3. **For image detection**:
   Modify the `image_file` variable in `main.py` to specify the path to your image file. The application will detect objects in the specified image.
